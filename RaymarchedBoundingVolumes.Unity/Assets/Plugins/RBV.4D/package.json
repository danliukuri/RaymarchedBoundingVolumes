  "description"     : "An extension package for RBV that introduce four-dimensional features. It enables the visualization and manipulation of 4D objects within raymarched volumes by slicing through these objects along a fourth spatial dimension and projecting them into 3D, while leveraging all the techniques provided by the core RBV package. This functionality allows for dynamic exploration of 4D geometry in a familiar 3D space.",
